    "Identify the problem – What are we trying to understand or predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "Make assumptions – What simplifications can we make?\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate the model – Use equations, functions, or probabilities.\n",

    "Mathematical models come in different types depending on what they describe and how they behave. Here are the main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deterministic vs. Probabilistic\n",
    "Deterministic models – Always give the same output for the same input (e.g., Newton’s laws).\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic (Stochastic) models – Include randomness and uncertainty (e.g., weather prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Static vs. Dynamic\n",
    "Static models – Do not change over time (e.g., supply and demand graphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic models – Change over time (e.g., population growth models).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Linear vs. Nonlinear\n",
    "Linear models – Have straight-line relationships (e.g., simple interest formula).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear models – Have curves or complex interactions (e.g., predator-prey models).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Discrete vs. Continuous\n",
    "Discrete models – Use specific values (e.g., number of people in a city).\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous models – Use smooth changes (e.g., temperature changes over time).\n",

    "A stochastic model is a mathematical model that includes randomness or uncertainty. Instead of giving a single fixed outcome, it predicts a range of possible outcomes with different probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Stochastic Models:\n",
